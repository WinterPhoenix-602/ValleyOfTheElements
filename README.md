# CIS131Final-Project

This project is a fairly barebones text-based rpg, played by inputting numbers corresponding to options presented in various menus.

The most recent stable version of this game can be accessed in TextBasedRPG.zip, and can be played after unzipping the folder by clicking on TextBasedRPG.exe. It should be near the bottom after you scroll down.

If you would rather look at the python files, the are still available for those who know how.

ANSI Escape codes, which are used to provide color in this project, are not enabled by default on windows. In order to enable colored text in the console you can run this command: reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1.
